    counting, and pre-emptive termination to take into account more filters (WiP)
- Personal Fanart.tv API key is now required to be entered in settings, in order to fetch
    extra and hq artwork

- Added option to enable/disable size filtering
    If you already use size filtering you'll have to enable this option, as it's off by default

    That means that scraping will stop when enough sources that meet your max quality
    and size filters criteria are found
- Added function that tries to circumvent data mismatches between metadata sites and scene releases
